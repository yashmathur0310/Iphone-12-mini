"Phone didn’t switch on. Battery is dead completely. I am a loyal I phone user. Didn’t expect from Apple to get a defective product.Adding to my agony, Amazon team is harassing me for replacement. First they need a report from apple team that I phone is defective and when I get that for replacement, Amazon delivery boy wants the phone to start so that he can inspect. There is no coordination between Amazon customer care and delivery team and now the delivery agent took the new phone back without giving me the replacement and I am again chasing Amazon team to send an email to delivery team to pick up the I phone and instruct them that defective phone will not get switched on.

"It has been more than 3 weeks since I got the new iPhone 12 mini.I have been an Apple customer since 2013. The first one was an iPhone 5. I had been using a 1st Gen iPhone SE since mid 2017. Even today the iPhone SE is a beast for regular usage. I had started loving the new iPhone 12 mini since its launch - as I like the flat edges and the small size.However, I had no plans to upgrade now. I usually wait until the new technologies (the full screen OLED display for example) to become stable and mature enough. I also wait until the model I like is a year or more old, so that the price is much lower than the launch price. But, my iPhone SE which had survived several falls earlier, suffered another fall and this time the touch stopped responding. The screen replacement cost was almost as much as the price I had paid for that phone.I got a decent offer on the purchase of the new iPhone 12 mini on Amazon. As expected Amazon delivered a factory sealed phone, well packed, the very next day. Setting the new phone up was very easy being an Apple Customer already. I just had to upgrade the OS and restore from my iCloud Backup.I like the white color body and the glass back. Having used to the bezels of the iPhone SE, the bezel less screen is the most I like from my upgrade. The 12 mini is slightly bigger than the 1st Gen SE but the different in the viewable area is so amazing. I also like the OLED screen so much.Battery has not been a problem for me as I do not play any games. So, even 24 hours after a full charge, I am left with about 30%. I have not experienced any heating during charging or during normal use.The 4G speeds are noticeably increased compared to the 1st Gen SE. The WiFi speeds have a big jump. Everything downloads so fast. I do have a router at home that supports MIMO and I connect on the 5GHz channel.I have been mostly on the WiFi so far. I don't know how the battery life will be when I am out using 4G data for 8-12 hours a day.Overall I am happy with my purchase so far!",weeks since got new iphone mini apple customer since first one iphone using 1st gen iphone se since mid even today iphone se beast regular usage started loving new iphone mini since launch like flat edges small size however plans upgrade usually wait new technologies full screen oled display example become stable mature enough also wait model like year old price much lower launch price iphone se survived several falls earlier suffered another fall time touch stopped responding screen replacement cost almost much price paid phone got decent offer purchase new iphone mini amazon expected amazon delivered factory sealed phone well packed next day setting new phone easy apple customer already upgrade os restore icloud backup like white color body glass back used bezels iphone se bezel less screen like upgrade mini slightly bigger 1st gen se different viewable area amazing also like oled screen much battery problem play games even hours full charge left experienced heating charging normal use 4g speeds noticeably increased compared 1st gen se wifi speeds big jump everything downloads fast router home supports mimo connect 5ghz channel mostly wifi far know battery life using 4g data hours day overall happy purchase far,0.988,positive

"Thanks to Apple for hearing the customer voice to bring in (another) small screen flagship mobile that’s easy to handle with one hand.This is my second iPhone and I’ve upgraded from SE first gen to 12mini.Undoubtedly it was the best choice for those who like small screen smartphone.Camera quality is great and it’s good in capturing Night mode, Wide angle and Portrait mode photos.

"It’s been a month since I bought this little fella and I’m in real love. I switched from android so it’s so great to explore iOS and to have the best mini mobile that apple ever made.I was in the idea to buy SE2020 as it looked handy and twas budget friendly. But my friends suggested to go with the mini if I’m looking for a smaller phone. Yes, it’s almost twice the budget of SE, I was worried to spend much at first but, believe me, no regrets at all after using it for a while!!The screen quality is so amazing and elite, you don’t need to worry about battery it’s smooth and long lasting, (can pair with a 13w for a bit faster charging and it lasts a bit longer). The looks are ultimate and of course it is hard and sturdy as they say. It is so small it perfectly fits your palm like you can type with just one hand and also its so tiny in pocket, you won’t feel a thing.Only two things I miss are-touch ID (a very lot) and-personally, I’m not a big fan of the new full screen displays. Like I’ve had my peace with the older type, but its Good too.It felt weird at first with the small screen while switching from bigger mobile. After regular use it’s really comfortable to move my eyes just little to look at my phone.",' month since bought little fella ' real love switched android ' great explore ios best mini mobile apple ever made idea buy se2020 looked handy twas budget friendly friends suggested go mini ' looking smaller phone yes ' almost twice budget se worried spend much first believe regrets using screen quality amazing elite ' need worry battery ' smooth long lasting pair 13w bit faster charging lasts bit longer looks ultimate course hard sturdy say small perfectly fits palm like type one hand also tiny pocket ' feel thing two things miss touch id lot personally ' big fan new full screen displays like ' peace older type good felt weird first small screen switching bigger mobile regular use ' really comfortable move eyes little look phone,0.9908,positive

"1) If privacy means anything to you, Apple is the answer right now. Google has gone to the path of everything that is wrong with big techs, and it took me 6 months to entirely come out of google ecosystem.2) Best small phone out there, if android isn’t even an option for point 1, this is the only choice anyway. I waited for the right sized small phone with right specs from apple. It fits perfectly in pocket, in hand, good one hand usage, it’s blocky enough not to slip out of hand.3) If you’re taking a small phone, most possibly you have a life and phone isn’t your life. The charge will live through the day for “phone like usage”. 5 hours screen on time is more than sufficient. For gaming get a gaming PC or console, for big screen get a big screen TV. If you want all in one device, pay more, get a bigger phone, or get a battery pack maybe? I’m tired of the battery argument, it’s a “phone” !!4) iOS wasn’t very easy to understand for someone moving from android first time. But it’s not too hard either, about a week I was uncomfortable in situations I had to hurry to do something or get something done, after a month usage I forgot the fact I am still new to this. iOS is intuitive enough, simple for anyone to use.5) For whatever reason everything in App store is so costly ! Most app doesn’t have any India cost adjustment, and they just convert whatever price they have in USD to INR. So be prepared. If you don’t like ads, get a VPN with ad blocker or any VPN with custom DNS to AdGuard servers.6) Screen quality is brilliant, it’s vibrant, it’s crisp, it’s very colour accurate, get bright enough indoor and outdoor, under sunlight no issues using.7) Speakers are pretty good, stereo setup, had very good lows, doesn’t crack at high volume, but guess what, if I use earphones for watching videos - battery life goes way better. For watching movies, online courses, better use a earphone, you won’t realise it has a small battery.8) It doesn’t come with a charging adapter. I’m still using my pixel 2 xl charger. Charges fast to 80%, then it’s a bit slower - but i guess that’s an expects behaviour.9) The charging cable seems weirdly stiff, I have read only bad reviews about them so be careful handling charging cable, use it with care, it will last long.10) Phone cameras has gone very far these days. It’s a very good camera here as well. I’m coming from Pixel 2 XL which had great camera and this one is even better. I don’t think people really need to bother too much about camera quality here. 4K video recording at 60 FPS .. what do you want more !!","privacy means anything apple answer right google gone path everything wrong big techs took months entirely come google ecosystem best small phone android ' even option point choice anyway waited right sized small phone right specs apple fits perfectly pocket hand good one hand usage ' blocky enough slip hand ' taking small phone possibly life phone ' life charge live day ""phone like usage"" hours screen time sufficient gaming get gaming pc console big screen get big screen tv want one device pay get bigger phone get battery pack maybe ' tired battery argument ' ""phone"" ios ' easy understand someone moving android first time ' hard either week uncomfortable situations hurry something get something done month usage forgot fact still new ios intuitive enough simple anyone use whatever reason everything app store costly app ' india cost adjustment convert whatever price usd inr prepared ' like ads get vpn ad blocker vpn custom dns adguard servers screen quality brilliant ' vibrant ' crisp ' colour accurate get bright enough indoor outdoor sunlight issues using speakers pretty good stereo setup good lows ' crack high volume guess use earphones watching videos battery life goes way better watching movies online courses better use earphone ' realise small battery ' come charging adapter ' still using pixel xl charger charges fast ' bit slower guess ' expects behaviour charging cable seems weirdly stiff read bad reviews careful handling charging cable use care last long phone cameras gone far days ' good camera well ' coming pixel xl great camera one even better ' think people really need bother much camera quality 4k video recording fps want",0.9934,positive
"It’s an iPhone... that is it... I have been using iPhone 5s and 6s since 2015 and got this only because of the mini size to fit in palm and carry around. And this is good only for that. Notch and bezels are very distracting. And somehow 6s was better type than this one.The phone in itself is good, it has a fine camera though telephoto lens is missed too much while taking portrait shots.Photos and videos are bright and good dynamic range, but it’s night mode is very ordinary specially selfies.But the biggest pain point are the speakers and battery. The speakers are ordinary compared to competition. It hardly gives 3-4 hours power on heavy usage. And around 5-5.5 hrs power on normal usage.If not for its small size I always prefer one plus 8 pro over this one which by the way is 15,000/- cheaper this phone even when I got mini on discount.This could have been a solid 3.5 star phone if the price was right but it is definitely overpriced by at least 25-30k for the trade off you have to make at 70-75k phone you can get flagship level phones at this price.

"To all those people who think it doesn’t have a good battery life, you’re wrong. It gives me 7+ hrs of screen on time always. And sometimes even 9+ hrs. I don’t do much gaming on it.

Did the device meet my expectations? I guess after 2 months of research i pretty much knew all the pros and cons of the device before buying it so i knew what i was getting into. Overall id say that im satisfied with the device.Over the internet mostly the complaints had been regarding the battery life of the Mini and honestly it didnt bother me at all. Gets me through the day easily and with a fast charger it charges up pretty quick aswell.The issue that conerns me is initially when the phone came out it had touch problems while using with a case and screen protector which apple has fixed but i feel that while the phone is charging the touch tends to misbehave.Phone might heat up while charging or playing alot of games.You might think that the screen size is too small for you but honestly switching over from bulky oneplus phones i feel this is more appropriate even with big hands.. i do make some mistakes while typing but ehhh you’ll get used to it. The quality of the display very much makes up for its size and watching HDR videos in 4k is just amazing.With the prices going down i would recommend going for a regular iPhone 12 but if the mini is something that suits your budget more you should go for it.,device meet expectations guess months research pretty much knew pros cons device buying knew getting overall id say im satisfied device internet mostly complaints regarding battery life mini honestly didnt bother gets day easily fast charger charges pretty quick aswell issue conerns initially phone came touch problems using case screen protector apple fixed feel phone charging touch tends misbehave phone might heat charging playing alot games might think screen size small honestly switching bulky oneplus phones feel appropriate even big hands make mistakes typing ehhh ' get used quality display much makes size watching hdr videos 4k amazing prices going would recommend going regular iphone mini something suits budget go,0.9305,positive

"I’m loving it. The size is what I like the most. Fits easily in one hand and also in my pocket. Actually it doesn’t seem to me a small phone. Not heavy at all. Screen touch is as smooth as butter. I have migrated from iPhone 6 to this. There are no black bands on the top and bottom like what is there in iPhone 6 or iPhone SE 2020.

"*****Using for 5 months*****Pathetic experience with apple customer care ****Summary: I have purchased the phone in Oct 2021 and I had to register a case with consumer helpline in Feb 2022. If you think you will get premium service because you have purchased a premium phone, you are terribly mistaken. Its always good to keep a standby (android/windows/basic) phone if you want to continue to be connected. Software complaint detected on 1st Feb and requested support from Apple customer care. Senior escalation team has wasted my 15 days however couldnt find a resolution. Finally, I lost all the data from i-cloud and from memory. Details are below if you are interested to know further. If you are self-declared iPhone promoter, better save your valuable time 😊****What was the issue with your i-phone?I faced a software complaint of Apple ID locked due to security reasons; need to reset password. Every time I unlock the password, it gets locked in the next second and it prevented me from using the phone or downloading any new application. There is a permanent notification in the apple Id suggestion that says, Some application in your phone require login with your apple ID. When I login with the ID, error pops up Unknown error occurred. When I clicked on Forgot password I was able to reset the password successfully. However, logging in again with the new password same error repeats. This continued in a never-ending loop.*****How the Apple customer Care team treated you so that you are very angry?They have flowered me with sweet words and high respect. They said that they are excited to help me. Also, every caller assured me that he/she would be taking the responsibility of my problem and will remain single contact point till the end.******You only said that Apple customer care people were so kind. Then why are you spreading negative information?Brother, when you raise a complaint, your primary requirement is to resolve the issue at the earliest and nothing else. Apple customer care did everything other than supporting with my issue.When I called first time, the Customer care executive listened my problem very carefully and asked to restart. I told her that I have done all soft techniques such as restart, reset, Restore etc. I am done with all options available in and outside apple website. Nothing helped that is why I called you. After 45 minutes of Sweet conversation she got finally convinced that the issue cannot be resolved by herself. She escalated to senior escalation team. Post usual welcome dialogues, senior escalation team wanted to listen my issue again 😌; I explained again. He understood the problem after 45 minutes and started to give same directions as the Customer executive given 😊 I told the same thing that I have tried all. But he insisted me to do that again over the call. Since restore activities are time consuming he promised me a call back and provided me a link to connect back him in case of any question. After doing the restore through I phone, there was no change. Instead, I lost all the application in the phone. Neither the SENIOR ESCALATION EXPERT called me back. Funniest part is that I am unable to communicate him through the link since it required APPLD ID login that doesnt work for me. ( I still doubt these guys understood my issue )I understood they are following a YouTube video that I have already seen. It seems the senior technical escalation team is being recruited after passing spoken English course. Sometimes I felt I am the expert 😊Hopefully you understood why I am frustrated. I had to call back customer care again repeat the step above of wasting 1 hrs to 1.30 hrs to find out NO solution!!!******Did the issue resolve?Unfortunately, no. I lost my entire data when the phone was restored in recovery mode. Since I couldnt disconnect the apple ID and phone, technical team had to help me and TAT for this action is 30 days. I requested for an alternate device as my work is getting impacted during this period, but they sweetly said NO. I had to purchase a new phone to continue with my work.****What is the status of your Consumer helpline complaint?I understand that the complaint has reached to Apple, and they are trying to please me through some tricks but not listening to my demands. I requested for compensation against the phone that I have purchased during this issue. I think this is going to be a long fight I am prepared for it.*******Thank you for reading. I hope this review will help you to take a right decision before making significant investment. ******",using months pathetic experience apple customer care summary purchased phone oct register case consumer helpline feb think get premium service purchased premium phone terribly mistaken always good keep standby android windows basic phone want continue connected software complaint detected 1st feb requested support apple customer care senior escalation team wasted days however couldnt find resolution finally lost data cloud memory details interested know self declared iphone promoter better save valuable time issue phone faced software complaint apple id locked due security reasons need reset password every time unlock password gets locked next second prevented using phone downloading new application permanent notification apple id suggestion says application phone require login apple id login id error pops unknown error occurred clicked forgot password able reset password successfully however logging new password error repeats continued never ending loop apple customer care team treated angry flowered sweet words high respect said excited help also every caller assured would taking responsibility problem remain single contact point till end said apple customer care people kind spreading negative information brother raise complaint primary requirement resolve issue earliest nothing else apple customer care everything supporting issue called first time customer care executive listened problem carefully asked restart told done soft techniques restart reset restore etc done options available outside apple website nothing helped called minutes sweet conversation got finally convinced issue cannot resolved escalated senior escalation team post usual welcome dialogues senior escalation team wanted listen issue explained understood problem minutes started give directions customer executive given told thing tried insisted call since restore activities time consuming promised call back provided link connect back case question restore phone change instead lost application phone neither senior escalation expert called back funniest part unable communicate link since required appld id login doesnt work still doubt guys understood issue understood following youtube video already seen seems senior technical escalation team recruited passing spoken english course sometimes felt expert hopefully understood frustrated call back customer care repeat step wasting hrs hrs find solution issue resolve unfortunately lost entire data phone restored recovery mode since couldnt disconnect apple id phone technical team help tat action days requested alternate device work getting impacted period sweetly said purchase new phone continue work status consumer helpline complaint understand complaint reached apple trying please tricks listening demands requested compensation phone purchased issue think going long fight prepared thank reading hope review help take right decision making significant investment,0.9944,positive
"To start with bought the mini from an offline store but not much of a price difference though. Just wanted immediately in my hands and don’t want to wait till it get delivered.Coming from Samsung galaxy S9 and realme x2 pro android phones, iOS is a breath of fresh airMain reason to buy the mini is because of the form factor. After using it for couple of days even my old S9 feel huge and bulky in my hands. Such a in hand feel. Completely love it.Don’t won’t to say much about other features like performance, display, camera etc. they are class leading and top notch.One thing on battery life. It’s more than decent and for a average user like me who just uses phone for calls and social media battery life is more than enough and lasts for a full day. In fact battery was one of main concern before I bought this phone. Now feeling relieved. Planning to use the phone as long as it is alive. Never felt this much satisfaction with my previous phones.Highly recommend if your budget is above 55k and not a heavy user, you will love it and trust me it will stand out in the crowd.",start bought mini offline store much price difference though wanted immediately hands ' want wait till get delivered coming samsung galaxy s9 realme x2 pro android phones ios breath fresh airmain reason buy mini form factor using couple days even old s9 feel huge bulky hands hand feel completely love ' ' say much features like performance display camera etc class leading top notch one thing battery life ' decent average user like uses phone calls social media battery life enough lasts full day fact battery one main concern bought phone feeling relieved planning use phone long alive never felt much satisfaction previous phones highly recommend budget 55k heavy user love trust stand crowd,0.9845,positive

"I used 5s , SE ,iphone 6s+ in the past and my current primary phone was Google pixel 2xl for the past 2.5 years and my wife is using SE 2. So based on the overall experience i can rate only 3 stars for the iphone mini because of its huge price tag.I am comparing this with the current gen SE 2. Ofcourse they are saying led display and all but if you compare to SE 2 you wont notice any difference at all. Infact SE 2 Display color accuracy is better for my eyes.Comparing to Camera. Its almost identical results in day light photos with the main cam. And wide lens is not that great in low light . Front camera is good.Speaker sound is good for both the phones but for Mini the ear peice quality is not good. Sounds very thin and volume is low compared SE 2Very handy to be single handed use and the face unlock is pretty fast.But just for the above 2 good points spending so much on this mini is not justifiable that too doesnt have a charging brick and earphones.So if you are looking for a compact iphone SE 2 is the best ever option. And during offers base model SE 2 was availble for 26k which is very much worth of that price tag.Update on 17/02/2021 from 3 start to 5 star.After using the phone for 2 weeks i can say this is really a great and power packed compact phone. Camera is really awesome and the battery backup is adequate for 1 day heavy usage (no games) .

"A thread on MacRumors with more than 250 replies found over 25% of iPhone users are impacted by the problem, there are also numerous complaints in the official Apple Support Communities forum. Given Apple has around 300M iPhone 12 and iPhone 11 models, if the MacRumors polling is representative, this is a huge problem.My personal opinion is this is not Apple throttling iPhones. The company claims battery improvements in recent years mean it no longer has to resort to such aggressive measures and the iPhone 12 range is just six months old, which is far too soon for any form of throttling (which Apple did to protect battery health). An urgent fix in the form of iOS 14.5.2 looks like the obvious answer.In the meantime, owners of iPhone 12 and iPhone 11 models have a tough decision to make. Do you leave your iPhones vulnerable to two serious security flaws or do you upgrade and risk a 1-in-4 chance of having the performance slashed in half? Whatever path you choose, Apple needs to address this, and fast.I have contacted Apple and will update this post if I receive a response.",thread macrumors replies found iphone users impacted problem also numerous complaints official apple support communities forum given apple around 300m iphone iphone models macrumors polling representative huge problem personal opinion apple throttling iphones company claims battery improvements recent years mean longer resort aggressive measures iphone range six months old far soon form throttling apple protect battery health urgent fix form ios looks like obvious answer meantime owners iphone iphone models tough decision make leave iphones vulnerable two serious security flaws upgrade risk chance performance slashed half whatever path choose apple needs address fast contacted apple update post receive response,0.25,positive
