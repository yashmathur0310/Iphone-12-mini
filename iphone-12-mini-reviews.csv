But in sunlight it has been struggling.Camera:- 4/5Although it has 2 camera but you will not notice any big difference in daylight. Somewhat differ in Low Light.2nd camera is for ultrawideSelfie camera is really very good.Video:- 5/5 dolby vision hdr is very good , but it is limited to only ur device. Not work for social media post (instagram)Battery:- 3/5Attached screen shot 100 to 6 percentProvide you about 6hr of screen time.Compact & very light in weightUsing samsung 15 W chargerFrom 6 to 80 percent it has been taken 66 minute.Back side glass getting hot while charge and even while using youtube. When use Camera it is super hot. Need to be solve this issueIf you have iPhone 11 then wait for next genNot worthy to pay 20-30 extra for only OLED displayUpdate you more after using it about a week."
I just say that this phone is awesome.. Small phone.. easy to use and it fit in pocket easily.. I must say one thing if you are confused in iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini then if you ll use phone as primary then go for iPhone 12 and if you ll use phone as secondary then go for iPhone 12 mini.. Like my primary phone is OnePlus 8T and secondary is iPhone 12 mini..And one more thing.. Battery backup is decent.. You can use one day easily if you are not a hard core gamer..
"Phone didn’t switch on. Battery is dead completely. I am a loyal I phone user. Didn’t expect from Apple to get a defective product.Adding to my agony, Amazon team is harassing me for replacement. First they need a report from apple team that I phone is defective and when I get that for replacement, Amazon delivery boy wants the phone to start so that he can inspect. There is no coordination between Amazon customer care and delivery team and now the delivery agent took the new phone back without giving me the replacement and I am again chasing Amazon team to send an email to delivery team to pick up the I phone and instruct them that defective phone will not get switched on. Buyers beware. This can happen to you."
"This is DAM small and looks like dummy piece, performance wise my MI note 3 is better than this.Don,t buy this. They will not replace or refund as well"
"All in all good phone those who loves compact phones. I have identified few things those who complain about battery life. Try these to improve battery life,1) try mobile data, bluetooth when not needed. With these two being on, I noticed considerable battery drain.2) when you are in remote places, try put it in airplane mode. This keeps phone searching for the network all the time and drains battery.3) hey Siri, please turn off yourself. I don't use it anymore. Keeping Siri always on is not a good thing.This might help!"
"Phone didn't work for one day even , worst customer service , worst amazon, they are not ready to replace even with in 7 days of purchase. NEVER BUY FROM THE SELLER"
Awsome product Thanks to Amazon ...placed order in first day and delivery is very fast....Mini but Powerful...
"Don't buy mini. I have used personally and after watching youtube for 30 minutes, thermal throttling came into effect, screen dims and heavy battery drain. Better go for iphone 12."
Screen is not responsive many times
"The phone looks perfect except the Battery back-up which only lasts for 3-4 hrs, I need to charge my handset 2-3 times a day. I have been using Iphone 6 for last 3 years but never experienced such issue until now."
Our phone was missing form the box
"A strange problem is visible. I am not able to pick up the incoming call after pasting the tempered glass on the screen. Once u remove the tempered glass, everything is fine. Apple should look into this."
"At the time of writing, self is using Apple default Apps and yet install my other apps like Bank, travel, e-commerce etc..With the above in mind, I would like to share that Mobile is very slow and hanging up frequently and further battery draining life is far below expectation. Overall these concerns are not expected either from Apple or Amazon brand.Kindly process return of the product and my refund."
"It has been more than 3 weeks since I got the new iPhone 12 mini.I have been an Apple customer since 2013. The first one was an iPhone 5. I had been using a 1st Gen iPhone SE since mid 2017. Even today the iPhone SE is a beast for regular usage. I had started loving the new iPhone 12 mini since its launch - as I like the flat edges and the small size.However, I had no plans to upgrade now. I usually wait until the new technologies (the full screen OLED display for example) to become stable and mature enough. I also wait until the model I like is a year or more old, so that the price is much lower than the launch price. But, my iPhone SE which had survived several falls earlier, suffered another fall and this time the touch stopped responding. The screen replacement cost was almost as much as the price I had paid for that phone.I got a decent offer on the purchase of the new iPhone 12 mini on Amazon. As expected Amazon delivered a factory sealed phone, well packed, the very next day. Setting the new phone up was very easy being an Apple Customer already. I just had to upgrade the OS and restore from my iCloud Backup.I like the white color body and the glass back. Having used to the bezels of the iPhone SE, the bezel less screen is the most I like from my upgrade. The 12 mini is slightly bigger than the 1st Gen SE but the different in the viewable area is so amazing. I also like the OLED screen so much.Battery has not been a problem for me as I do not play any games. So, even 24 hours after a full charge, I am left with about 30%. I have not experienced any heating during charging or during normal use.The 4G speeds are noticeably increased compared to the 1st Gen SE. The WiFi speeds have a big jump. Everything downloads so fast. I do have a router at home that supports MIMO and I connect on the 5GHz channel.I have been mostly on the WiFi so far. I don't know how the battery life will be when I am out using 4G data for 8-12 hours a day.Overall I am happy with my purchase so far!"
"I bought this phone for its size. Wonderfully sized iPhone, very suitable for one handed usage. Very pocketable. But battery life is very less. Moderate usage also wont help you last a day."
"Thanks to Apple for hearing the customer voice to bring in (another) small screen flagship mobile that’s easy to handle with one hand.This is my second iPhone and I’ve upgraded from SE first gen to 12mini.Undoubtedly it was the best choice for those who like small screen smartphone.Camera quality is great and it’s good in capturing Night mode, Wide angle and Portrait mode photos. It can capture video upto 4K 60fps, which is close to real-time recording.Sound quality is also good with Dolby playback and stereo video recording.It’s same spec as iPhone 12 with 5.4” screen.I’m getting 5+ hours of screen on time with regular use of watching YouTube, Insta, and WhatsApp. Battery life is good.Really a satisfying upgrade from SE1 .."
"If u r looking for a very compact designed secondary phone, u can definitely go for this.I got it for ~56k which i find not very much expensive since almost everything is similar to iphone 12."
"It’s been a month since I bought this little fella and I’m in real love. I switched from android so it’s so great to explore iOS and to have the best mini mobile that apple ever made.I was in the idea to buy SE2020 as it looked handy and twas budget friendly. But my friends suggested to go with the mini if I’m looking for a smaller phone. Yes, it’s almost twice the budget of SE, I was worried to spend much at first but, believe me, no regrets at all after using it for a while!!The screen quality is so amazing and elite, you don’t need to worry about battery it’s smooth and long lasting, (can pair with a 13w for a bit faster charging and it lasts a bit longer). The looks are ultimate and of course it is hard and sturdy as they say. It is so small it perfectly fits your palm like you can type with just one hand and also its so tiny in pocket, you won’t feel a thing.Only two things I miss are-touch ID (a very lot) and-personally, I’m not a big fan of the new full screen displays. Like I’ve had my peace with the older type, but its Good too.It felt weird at first with the small screen while switching from bigger mobile. After regular use it’s really comfortable to move my eyes just little to look at my phone."
Received iPhone with scratches. Please arrange to return the product as I am trying but it’s not working. It’s used product.
Buy only after checking the screen quality physically from a store.Iphone 12 series has a serious screen issue.The screen has an abnormally yellow shade comparable to sephia mode used in photos.It has reduced the display quality and overall content quality is impacted due to this.Service center has no answer for this they have given me in writing that its a manufacturing issue.Buy only if you are ok with an absolutely yellow screen like night shift is always on types even if its off.So beware - just search online for iphone 12 yellow tint issue.
"1) If privacy means anything to you, Apple is the answer right now. Google has gone to the path of everything that is wrong with big techs, and it took me 6 months to entirely come out of google ecosystem.2) Best small phone out there, if android isn’t even an option for point 1, this is the only choice anyway. I waited for the right sized small phone with right specs from apple. It fits perfectly in pocket, in hand, good one hand usage, it’s blocky enough not to slip out of hand.3) If you’re taking a small phone, most possibly you have a life and phone isn’t your life. The charge will live through the day for “phone like usage”. 5 hours screen on time is more than sufficient. For gaming get a gaming PC or console, for big screen get a big screen TV. If you want all in one device, pay more, get a bigger phone, or get a battery pack maybe? I’m tired of the battery argument, it’s a “phone” !!4) iOS wasn’t very easy to understand for someone moving from android first time. But it’s not too hard either, about a week I was uncomfortable in situations I had to hurry to do something or get something done, after a month usage I forgot the fact I am still new to this. iOS is intuitive enough, simple for anyone to use.5) For whatever reason everything in App store is so costly ! Most app doesn’t have any India cost adjustment, and they just convert whatever price they have in USD to INR. So be prepared. If you don’t like ads, get a VPN with ad blocker or any VPN with custom DNS to AdGuard servers.6) Screen quality is brilliant, it’s vibrant, it’s crisp, it’s very colour accurate, get bright enough indoor and outdoor, under sunlight no issues using.7) Speakers are pretty good, stereo setup, had very good lows, doesn’t crack at high volume, but guess what, if I use earphones for watching videos - battery life goes way better. For watching movies, online courses, better use a earphone, you won’t realise it has a small battery.8) It doesn’t come with a charging adapter. I’m still using my pixel 2 xl charger. Charges fast to 80%, then it’s a bit slower - but i guess that’s an expects behaviour.9) The charging cable seems weirdly stiff, I have read only bad reviews about them so be careful handling charging cable, use it with care, it will last long.10) Phone cameras has gone very far these days. It’s a very good camera here as well. I’m coming from Pixel 2 XL which had great camera and this one is even better. I don’t think people really need to bother too much about camera quality here. 4K video recording at 60 FPS .. what do you want more !!"
"It’s an iPhone... that is it... I have been using iPhone 5s and 6s since 2015 and got this only because of the mini size to fit in palm and carry around. And this is good only for that. Notch and bezels are very distracting. And somehow 6s was better type than this one.The phone in itself is good, it has a fine camera though telephoto lens is missed too much while taking portrait shots.Photos and videos are bright and good dynamic range, but it’s night mode is very ordinary specially selfies.But the biggest pain point are the speakers and battery. The speakers are ordinary compared to competition. It hardly gives 3-4 hours power on heavy usage. And around 5-5.5 hrs power on normal usage.If not for its small size I always prefer one plus 8 pro over this one which by the way is 15,000/- cheaper this phone even when I got mini on discount.This could have been a solid 3.5 star phone if the price was right but it is definitely overpriced by at least 25-30k for the trade off you have to make at 70-75k phone you can get flagship level phones at this price. Take this only if you have to have small screen iPhone. It is of no other use."
"To all those people who think it doesn’t have a good battery life, you’re wrong. It gives me 7+ hrs of screen on time always. And sometimes even 9+ hrs. I don’t do much gaming on it. Mostly insta, youtube, calling and video calls. It charges really quick with apple’s 20 watt charger. Performance is awesome as expected. Camera is significantly better than iphone 11. And display just crushes iphone 11 lcd display. It’s really slim and lightweight but sometimes screen feels a bit small. Like sometimes i wish to be a lil bigger like 5.8” but then again the weight is something that I enjoy every time i hold it. Most of the media i consume is on ipad so if you only have your phone for media consumption, don’t go with it. Save a lil extra and go with iphone 12."
"Delivery :- As usual spot on got the phone jaut before lockdown at my place.Battery Life :- Average, can last a day depending on your usage. But battery drain is there since its a pretty powerful chip eventhough the screen is 5.4”.Screen :- Beautiful OLED screen doesnt make me miss 120hz.Device overall :- Compact, powerful, beautifully craft piece and can be used pretty easily with one hand.Who is this device for :- a. Those who are tired of big screen phones. b. Who dont do hardcore gaming. c. Who isnt glued to their phone 24/7 - SOT will be around 8 hr mark for normal use. d. Who want the best iPhone but cant splash a hell lot of money🤪I love this iteration of iPhone even though its small and its a lot better than iPhone SE."
"One of best phone from apple so far. I used to love I phone 5S because of the looks and feel of that and here we go, Its I phone 12 looks similar to that but much more powerful. Amazing compact phone."
Screen size is usually small as compared to what we r used to these days but m happy using this mini version of iPhone... battery could b better as it’s not a big deal to improve for Apple but God knows why they r not working upon it... otherwise people who r stil not adjusted with big mobile phones should definitely consider this one as I was not happy with my earlier 6.4 screen size mobile just bcoz it wasn’t handy for me... must buy
I’m not sure whether I’m holding IPhone 12 mini or Mi phone. It is heating too much and some times hanging when I use. I just got 3 days back. Not sure whether it will same across this product or only I received faulty one
"Good phone with less battery. Remind me of my old sony z1 compact. Iphone 12 mini is a small beast you need to survive everyday. Great camera, great display. Water and dust resistance seems good for men with laborious activities like me. I wish battery could have been better."
This is my first apple device and the worst experience with Apple. Keypad freezes now and then ( don't know whether apps are not optimized for the device or device itself is the problem). Even I've got first unit replaced yet not satisfied with the other that I've received as replacement. Don't know if the problem is with 12 mini or with my device.
"One of the best iPhone ever made, have been using for more than a month now and assuming it’s a right time to share my experience with an iconic iPhone.PlusesAesthetics - simply phenomenal, no more need to hold with two hands while writing a text or sending messageWeight- super light phone to hold even with coverPerformance- A14 Bionic chip is super fast and get all work done with an easeCamera - one of the best camera phone i have used in recent times, no comparison between iPhone pro max pictures otherwise it’s super bright and clear even night pictures are decent comparative to old iPhonesDeltasPower adapter and Earphones are not available which is a bummerBattery life could have been betterOne request to all iPhone users out their, please buy iPhone 12 mini and I’m sure u fall for it every day and revive ur iPhone 4,4s,5 and 5s memories.Thanks,Saurabh Gunwal"
Did the device meet my expectations? I guess after 2 months of research i pretty much knew all the pros and cons of the device before buying it so i knew what i was getting into. Overall id say that im satisfied with the device.Over the internet mostly the complaints had been regarding the battery life of the Mini and honestly it didnt bother me at all. Gets me through the day easily and with a fast charger it charges up pretty quick aswell.The issue that conerns me is initially when the phone came out it had touch problems while using with a case and screen protector which apple has fixed but i feel that while the phone is charging the touch tends to misbehave.Phone might heat up while charging or playing alot of games.You might think that the screen size is too small for you but honestly switching over from bulky oneplus phones i feel this is more appropriate even with big hands.. i do make some mistakes while typing but ehhh you’ll get used to it. The quality of the display very much makes up for its size and watching HDR videos in 4k is just amazing.With the prices going down i would recommend going for a regular iPhone 12 but if the mini is something that suits your budget more you should go for it.
"Battery life is small compared to modern day android phones, but it lasts me a whole day on intermediate use with 20-30% left at the end and it additionally charges 50% in half hour so thats handy.Love the form factor, been craving for a smaller device for a long time.Works like a charm!"
Iphone mini is in small screen but best in all sense.. thats it. The only thing is which i dont like it isbvery expensive.
"Similarly specced android handsets are available for supposedly much (much much) cheaper. Some people buy iPhones because it's sort of a status symbol. I couldnt care less about that. I just tend to value my privacy a bit more than what android pays me (in terms of cheaper upfront handsets).As far as review of the phone is concerned, there are many available online. I'd simply say that I'm more than satisfied with this."
Iphone 12 Mini is very cute.. Low weight.. Eazy to hold.. More over great performance.. Face recognition speed.. Display clarity.. Sound clarity.. Camera perfection.. Everything is just awesome. One difficulty I faced that there is no Charger inside the box. Since its a Ctype to Lightning charger Iam forced to purchase a charger. But there is no stock in any of the showrooms.. Usb to lightning cable costs same as charger.Thanks to Amazon and HDFC for providing extra discount..
Camera is like Redmi 7A. I cant find any difference between less than 8k priced phone.Image Sharpness is zero.Battery will not last for office time.If you need a showoff hand set obviously go for it.You cant access your sms otp in some useful web app. Again if you want a showoff phone please go for it.You can't send a file through whatsapp etc etc. In name of security if don't able to do useful task then it simple useless.Prime attraction the camera is worse.
"Awesome. Product as described. I use WhatsApp(20-30min), mail(15-20min), internet(10-15min), phone(about 10-15 incoming calls not more than 2 min. and 10-12 outgoing calls not more than 3 min. & Apple TV(about 1hr) and my battery lasts almost up to 40 hr. Its a feature packed phone with worlds best mobile chip inside. Hats off to Appario Retail for such an excellent deal. Product & service quality what they supply deserves 5 star by default. Thank you Appario Retail. I will certainly buy from this seller in coming days."
"Got this phone for a good deal for rs 60500/- 128gb and Battery is very decent. Avoid this phone if you are gamer. I charge my phone mostly with 80 to 90% daily and battery charge withstands for a whole day easily. It is very compact and pocket friendly. As Usual apple did a good job in terms of Performance, camera, display. Buy a 20w charger, with 40mins charge is enough to survive for a day..."
"A very compact , lightweight and a handy powerhouse ever.With an OLED display and processor A14 same as the high end model, 12 Mini is excelling smartphone industry with a 5.4 inch screen in a small body. The battery is really sufficient (Manageable and good for a little gaming and heavy activities). I had iPhone XR before this and compared to that , the battery is pretty similar and 12 mini is more efficient than older models (Based on usage and standby time) .I am highly satisfied with iPhone 12 Mini as this was the phone i have always wanted.This review might not appeal to large screen users as some love small screen and some do not! But this is the best in the world if you are considering for a small screen smartphone."
ONE & ONLY iPHONE.....
"I’m loving it. The size is what I like the most. Fits easily in one hand and also in my pocket. Actually it doesn’t seem to me a small phone. Not heavy at all. Screen touch is as smooth as butter. I have migrated from iPhone 6 to this. There are no black bands on the top and bottom like what is there in iPhone 6 or iPhone SE 2020. Till now the battery backup also seems to be ok , maybe because my usage is not much and the phone is not even 10 days old. If I charge 100% on day one morning , the battery shows 20% on the afternoon of day two. Delivery by Amazon was top notch as usual and I got a good deal too."
"After all it’s iPhone no need to mention anything personally I like the size of phone it’s perfect for every hand, look and feel really premium. Speaker output is average not loud compared to my redmi k20 pro which has single down firing speakers. Camera is awesome but limited options with camera app. Only battery is little downstairs but enough for moderate use.Finally I got it for 55k on Amazon with HDFC 9k instant discount which is worth buy.If u want small size big bomb then go for iPhone 12 mini u will never regret abt it."
"Excellent cameras day and nightCompact size for corporates and business peopleExcellent Retina display, speakers are loud enough with chill nessIt’s like a new born baby from IPhone FamilyLol...People who love to have a compact size phone on hands can blindly go for this model.The cable given in the box is different and not like the previous models so guys you should purchase a USB C TYPE 20w adapter to charge your iPhone."
"To those who are buying this phone for PUBGPros : PUBG is very much playable with no frame drops.U will get 2.5 to 3 hours play time on smooth ultra graphics.Moving to small screen may take some time to adjust especially the layouts.There is heating issue on continuous play which I manage with a fan.Those who are buying only for PUBG can go for iphone 11 which has bigger battery,screen,better thermals etc.best for who are a casual gamer who plays 2-3 hours a day, who like the premium small form factor, a good camera and polished iOS"
I have been looking for an iPhone that’s smaller as a second phone with full screen and iPhone 12 mini has fulfilled by requirement. Everything an iPhone is in a smaller form factor. Brilliant as a second phone and if you are looking for smaller phones in a market that is crowded with above 6 inch smartphones which are a pain in the hand.
Battery is not charging from 1st day of purchase. And there is no response from amazon for return the damage product.
I am iPhone user from 10 year n so used almost iPhone XR . And this was another upgrade for me after long .. every thing is as expected but 4g network keep greeting disconnected ..I regret that I paid more now it is coming in 56000 after republicn hsfc bank discount n got in 61000 . I can return to get its bigger brother
Small form factor great display great battery. A handy device for those who do not like giant devices but want a performance beast and excellent camera 64k for 128gb variant. Best deal✌🏻.
Writing this review after 3 months of use-The phone is smaller than I expected if you watch contents on mobile then don’t go for it.Let me tell u what’s important-After first month my iPhone 12 mini got freezed with no response.So I have to take the phone to nearby apple customer service centre and they took the phone did some checks and told me that my phone will be sent to bangaluru for further diagnostics and repairing.I didn’t liked that they are saying that I hv to stay without my phone for 10 days.Actually something more disturbing was that a new apple phone gets this much problem.I was disappointed. My phone was returned and the issue they told was that the motherboard was replaced.So all this was very kind of bad experience.Now it’s doing good.Thank you. Sorry for grammatical mistakes!!!
"This phone is nice but Amazon is fraud. They have sold me device manufactured in Nov 2020 in June 2021. After using this phone for 2 months , phone was dead. They didn’t allow for replacement. Thanks to Apple they repaired my mobile."
This phone has the worst battery life than any other ones. Because of the smaller size of the phone battery capacity is very low. Without even any usage for few hours the battery goes down by 8-9%. This is not worth the price of the phone and very disappointing coming from Apple.
Amazing phone if you don’t like to carry big screen phones. Touch is amazing and very fast phone. No heating.Battery life is good if you are not using it a lot for video calls.
I'm an Android user and decided to switch to iPhone and bought this mini.The phone seems very small if you have switched from a 6.1-inch screen. But after days of using you will get adjusted and no issues with it.The charging is not great as any android. After using the Mi phone this lacks battery way too often if you use your mobile much.
Iphone 12 with network issue. Not able to call or recieve incoming calls. Each and every time we need to swith to airpolane mode to get the network up an running but it till last only for 30mins.Tried resettingUpdated to the latest firmwareBut still the issue is not resolved. Issue occured after 2 months of using the device
"Box seal was open , i think it was used product sent to me. Also iphone tm at the back is not available, is it apple product?? Need to return"
"If your a fan of the iPhone 5, SE series due to its form factor this phone is definitely one you would love.Battery life is pretty much alright and isn’t concerning, depending on how far you would be from charging points.Now over 8 months of usage have to say never been happier."
"If you have been a fan of iPhone 5s for its compact size and looking for something similar with super powered configurations. Go for it.Battery backup is good, that actually depends on what all apps you use and how long you are on the onscreen apps.Battery backup is going to be likewise even in iPhone 12 PRO (with great screen comes great battery usage)"
Photo quality not good. Amazon service is worst and not expected this. Tried to return in 1 day of phone receipt but that went in to def ears. Feel did mistake buying this from Amazon.
Battery need a backup every time better to have a power bank with you to maintain this tiny phone
Perfect single hand phone... after almost a decade.Pros -1) Everything is good if you want single hand phone - it’s perfect sizeCons -1) Update the software to latest before putting the screen guard... on the base software version - touch screen is unresponsive when in contact with screen guard
It is quite big and not actually as small as I thought . It is bigger than 5s and has a very good camera quality . I can use it the whole day without charging it the second time . It fits well in ones hand . I bought a red phone and the phone looks really stunning in red . The processing speed is good and display quality is simply awesome
"It’s a nightmare getting familiar to iOS coming from android. No interoperability. Either you get into the apple ecosystem or you are out of luck. iOS is ages behind, feels like I’m in 2001"
"Very nice very small mobile, very costly, but promoting China"
phone is very small can slip from your hand i want to change it but amazon is not eligible after 7 days I thought to change i am helpess
Good one from apple who loves small phones battery life we will get around 5.8 to 7 hours full on screen time nice call quality best camera tiny in hands to carry nice look overall nice product if we use 20w charger fast charging also available using it from 2 months everything is fine
Wowforget about everything and go for itbest part of this iphone is nearby people don't recogniseBattery backup is also good don't know why ppl complain about it
"I used the the earlier iPhone6 which was brought from US. This time I bought it online. Feel the difference quality of product for US and India. Though both phones have label ""designed in California, assembled in china"" , is it true that China treat US and India with different quality ?"
Best Buy and good discount.
Face ID is clumsyTouch is not smoothBattery life and charging is a big issueShortcuts and flow is not well thought outHad a much better experience with my oneplus
Facing a lot of battery drain issues after playing any song on speaker it start draining very fast even if you stop music drainage didn't stopped.
"Been an iPhone user from 5s. Don't like bulky phones which restrict single hand use. So when apple launched this i made up mind to get this. Its kinda downgrade in screen size from XS, but i love the edges."
"I upgraded from iPhone 7 to iPhone 12 mini.Definitely the new iPhone is better in terms of camera,sound and touch screen.However,battery is still an issue.It drains quite easily in basic functions like calling and whatsapping.The new phone requires one charging a day.If I use it heavily and watch vedios ,then the phone needs to be charged twice in a day."
"One of the lightest iphone ever, no doubt after month of usage , robust performance , crisp and clear display. If you are a heavy user, Battery backup will nt be there throughout the day.Overall worth every Penny"
"Best compact phone , for old iPhone lovers"
"The best thing Apple have done is the display. It's gorgeous even though people say it's small but it's so beautiful and adequate. The rest of things like configuration, software and camera are top notch. I wud definitely recommend it to anyone who wants the best of Apple in a compact device."
Great device . The overall dimensions and the screen size is amazingly compact — much more than pics. I am using this as my 2nd device apart from older Xs Max . And I much prefer the Mini over the bulky Xs Max. Also the camera is much better and improved than Xs Max . Best thing is being able to keep the phone in my shirt pocket !
Perfect little phone. Small in size but no corners cut for features. This phone supports gigabit lte along with so many 5g bands making this phone really future proof. Camera quality is as always superb. IOS With the powerful processor makes everything so smooth. Sound quality is A1. Only thing .. there is no fingerprint reader for iphones these days ..
"Battery life is pathetic, doesn’t last more than 6-7 hrs. The screen resolution is awesome. The performance is good. Apple could have provided the charging adapter. Had to purchase that additionally. Built quality is good and handy to use."
"Got this for 60 k(128gb) during the republic day sale. I was earlier a little worried about the battery life but indeed I found it to be at my expectations.In office,use it is able to spend the day with about 30 percent battery remaining. So I guess for office use this phone is good and even compact . Main issue you may face is of the screen as it is just 5.4 inches ..."
I switched on my phone after 12-14 days of its delivery because I didn't have the sim at the time delivery but now as I m trying to get it on it isn't showing any response at all. Kindly help with a solution.
"Against other reviews, I am getting pretty decent battery life. Touch response is very quick. Camera is the main USP of this phone... proved to be a worthy buy..👍🏻"
Pros1. Good processor2. IOS safety and security3. Better front and rear CameraCons1. Too pricy for what it delivers2. Paint started piling off within first week of purchase (Biggest disappointment)3. Face regonition gesture too buggy
Excellent phone and handy phone simple word wow and amazon.in thanks a lot very very cheap price 65k 128 delivery is very fast!!!
"The republic day sale is very amusing on this product pricing. This product now costs less than that was available during that sale. Hdfc provides more discount than the sbi card at the time of sale. Seeing this, I am Now Disappointed with this pricing at the sale time. Would have saved atleast INR 4,500 if I have bought this now using hdfc card. Rubbish"
"Had some concerns about battery from the reviews. But it turned out decent for my regular use. I think it may be a concern if you constantly play games. With normal use of occasional calls, videos, songs and browsing, it comes 1 full day easily. Rest of the aspects about the phone are of course the best - speed, screen and the FORM FACTOR! Great to use a solid phone that is small and fits the hand."
"I upgraded to a 12 mini from a 7 and If you are someone who use a lot of phone for work and entertainment you would probably end up charging twice a day!Overall build quality is amazing, the phone heats up if there are a lot of tasks running and wouldn’t last a day."
"I ordered white one and performance is soo smooth soo smooth, in short i love it.. if you normal user like only web surfing or social its very good phone for you. Not for gaming or heavy or video shooting due to mini battery."
One of the best iphone I've ever used till date . Seriously now a days all the phones you get nowadays are either too heavy or too long . But this iPhone 12 mini it's apt in your hands.so much comfortable in one hand usage.Battery is good will last for single day usage.Performance is at best .Camera fantastic performance
"Except battery which is most needed now a days , everything else is fine"
The media could not be loaded. I’ve opened my box phone is not there please help
"This tiny beast is so perfect, completely fits in the hand, you can do everything without finger exercise. The reason I was using 7 is the size, from 7 to 12 mini is just wow. Smaller than iphone 7 with the larger display. Performance is too fast, camera superb and awesome feel in the hand."
"Absolutely fine. Little bit battery issue there.. For me, it’s perfectly fine as i am not using much internet on phone.I love this iPhone12mini because it’s really mini 😊"
"Pros Good Camera, Compact and fast OS . Only cons is it’s battery"
It is a very good phone. After using big size phones for long time and when I took this mini phone makes me very comfortable. It is light weight and handy. Thanks
"As the name says, it is small but handy. Only drawback is battery. Bought at 58999, apple is always overpriced. We are paying just for the brand, if you are extreme pro phone user who will explore all the features and use effectively then go ahead and buy 12 series.Battery needs to be charged every day, if you are a gamer don't buy 12mini. Apart from this iPhone mini is at its best."
"This iphone 12 mini is for light to medium users for heavy users you need to charge the battery at the end of the day.Camera- 5/5Battery- 5/5Call quality- 5/5Screen quality- 5/5Coming from oneplus6 the iphone has much better screen quality, camera is excellent.And the size is perfect for onehand use.You will have a long software updates cycle 4 to 5 years."
Too small in size.Very efficient in data transfer from previous iphone. Almost like a clone in 30 minutes.Light weight.Camera not that great as claimedOverall bit overpriced in terms of value for money
This is the perfectly designed phone to fit in one palm . All of its features are of iphone12 except battery size which i dont mind as my day is not getting spend in phone that much.
After two months 7 days of use device got shut down completely and not turning on
"Battery life too short, getting too much heat, Not worth of money..iPhone 11 was better..screen size is also very small in mini"
"Good product from Apple .Major con is less battery life and I dropped my phone from a short distance and t a scratch in the screen, why I am specifying this is Apple advertises iPhones as if it can even withstand a nuclear bomb that’s why.Over all worthy product !!"
"Amazing phone with all the features that make it perfect. Must have phone for everyone. Expect the battery life, that one needs a big revamp for the price paid. The battery drains of quite quickly too."
"Battery life is good, SIZE of this phone what I was excited for and trust me it is the best mini phone out there in market. A perfect phone with no compromise at all."
"I wanted the handy and quality phone, this iPhone is really nice and handy with amazing camera and battery is good too. It get charged within 30 to 40 minutes till 70 to 80%"
"Good phone for iPhone lovers. Battery life is good, can be improved bit more. Phone can be little bigger in size. Quality wise perfect iPhone. Go for it!"
Sorry Apple..You are still not user friendly..i am comparing you with samsung...
The media could not be loaded. Amazing
amazon didn't included charging cable and ejector pin inside the box. when I asked about it they saying they kept is in good manner but I don't know to where it went. even not given replacement for facing technical problem of mobile.
Good product but I had to return and reorder for a different piece. The sim tray failed to open when it is pressed with the needle. Apple call centre quickly responded and recommended for return. I booked again for a different cell. Thanks to Amazon and Apple.
"After using it for 2 months i realised, battery is not very good and it has some minor issues as well, maybe because of its size and compatibility with other hardware. Better to go with 11 pro for better camera, screen etc. in almost same price."
"Waster of money, after using of 4 month, screen display trint clour Green,,,,,, no action till now from service , I spent 70,000Not getting any service"
I see no reason why people buy oversized phones just for a big screen.This one slides into my pockets so easily.TBH I would have bought the SE if it wasn’t for the 12 mini. But the processor matters and this one works awesome.
One of my best purchase. The size is perfect and the performance is out of the world. The only downside is the battery life if you are a heavy user but the 18w charger charges this mini in quiet a small time.Just go for it if you can get it in the sale.
"iphones stubbornly sick to ios,apple store itunes, and hence much cumbersome &complicated than android"
"The simple word to describe is , it's a beast in compact size. Really mesmerizing quality and speed. If you are iOS lover and like small and compact size mobiles, it's very best choice for you. Soon buy it, because production of 12 mini stopped by Apple"
"With the OLED display and the A14 Bionic, you can expect a seamless and lighting speed experience when it comes to shuttling between apps. Battery is a pain point, no doubt, but this compact phone is apt for a not-so-heavy user like me."
I have been shifted from iphone 6s to this and it’s really great..! All performance is really great as compared to Iphone 11 except the fact that it has a small screen but if you feels great holding a small and handy phone in your hand then this mobile is for you..!
Excellent features and excellent screen. Battery life lasts for more than a day on normal usage.
Worst experience.. battary is same like 5S . look is also like iPhone 5s ..In 3 months time only mic and speaker has gone .. not a worth product in this range . I think I phone 11 is much better than 12 mini
Excellent phone!! Must buy if you like small phones. I am getting 2 days battery. So don’t believe in hearsay!! Overall out of the world experience!! I call it my Jerry Mouse as i have Tom Cat Note 20 ultra also!!
Tq amazon and hdfc however retail offers turned to be 2k cheaper. Anyhow its fantastic phone and loving it.
"I have ordered iPhone 12 mini and the shield was already opened & phone was hanging & heating too much , battery backup 1.30 hours only without using the apps PLEASE DO NOT SHOP WITH AMAZONE."
"Awesome look and feel, this is exactly the size i have been looking for as i do prefer watching videos or playing games on my mac .This is perfect for meWas a bit concerned about the battery life but so far i easily cross a day at one charge"
Screen size is very small than my expectation. No return policy.
I order this but as soon as I saw thought to return but they don’t return once delivered. It’s hard after spending that much amount and you can’t return. Wanted to buy iPhone 12 instead of mini but as per the return policy I can’t. That’s the only reason to give 1 star.
"Small , Sweet , and Strong phone damn that blue color is simply too good . Iphone improve sound quality .Really best purchase as compare to iphone 11"
This phone heats up so Quick and hanged few times. When I asked for replacement they said they can’t .. very upset
Totally disappointed.. Don't buy apple Product in Amazon..Sure they will send a defective one and won't replace or refund your money.Amazon customer service is too bad.
The best thing about this phone is it’s size ...Same as I phone 12 but it’s a size which is very comfy is hand !!!So if you are not a big fan of large screen ... this is the best
"Good product. I was looking for a minimalistic designed apple product, which this product is !!The design, specs, everything is good. The battery part is the only thing that pulls back this product, rest is superb.."
"Enaaa mobile ya 🤩🥳 pakka mass iPhone iPhone dhan😍🤩🤩Best camera / battery life stand till night, gamers stay away from this mini! bcos it’s mini flagship!! 10/10 💘"
"It’s value for money, I don’t regret buying this at all."
Very handy and comfortable. Smallest powerful phone with all latest features and incredible camera . Definitely it’s worth buying. Battery could have been bigger like iPhone 12 still we can manage 15-16 hours in a day.
"In less than 6 months, rear camera not working, battery health became 90%.. Highly disappointed and feeling like my family member is sick :( very sad :("
Battery is not great
"Romba varshathuku aprma, kai ku adakama oru phone da yapapaa! Pocket la vachitu dairyamaa suthalam"
The rear mic in product I got stopped working after 10 days they didn't replace my mobile as well.Worst experience for spending such amount in amazon... Everyone who ever wanted to buy a brand new things.. buy in respctive stores... Not through amazon...
A descent handy phone with fully loaded latest chip and cameras. battery life is also good as compare to my previous iphoneX.
"Grt phone with high performance in mini smartphone, size is perfect for all kinds of use except for gaming.Pubg run very smoothly on lit but screen size a bit smaller.Camera and battery life are good."
"To compact, keys are too small for adults. Battery doesn’t last more than 3 hours if you continuities it. Phone heats up very fast, you need to keep it in low brightness."
"Similar with iphone 5s in size and features, the only drawback is charger not available and have purchased extra with Rs. 1900/-"
"I ve to upgrade from iPhone 6s (purchased in jan 2016 for 63k) waiting for same size model.. finally , I felt the price was affordable with that 10k cash back.Product is upto my expectation!"
worst mobile
Simply said excellent in all the aspects but you must check the manufacturing date of set because battery life starts from the day one.
"Except battery, where it’s juice can’t stay for a whole day, rest all seems very good with this phone."
Everyone know about apple products so will not go in great details but nice phone and meets the expectations of someone upgrading from iPhone 8.Appreciate the lightening fast delivery from Amazon and seller. Full 5 stars to them.
My touch is not working fine
Apple has done a great job by bringing a lower range phone in a mini version. The only difference between i phone 12 and mini is the screen size and offcourse the battery life. Its my first i phone and I am pretty happy with it.
"It's my first iPhone ans trust me, the experience is can't be explained. I've been using android for 9 years and always wanted to shift to iphone. Becoz iPhone 12 mini will be usable till 2024 but no Android of 2021 will be seen anywhere in 2024-25"
Everything is cool and smooth as iphone 12 except for the smaller battery! Smaller phone = Smaller battery!I accept this since I prefer smaller screen phones to larger for daily use!
Toooo small
Compact in size and cost ! Outstanding and n performance
Best handy iphone ever
iPhone has few small small issues but other then that love this iPhone especially this colour Red.Wish I would have bought this in sale in 40k then that would be a great deal.It’s worth in 40k
Battery life is okay apart from that very good phone
A great phone overall. Only problem is battery won’t last all day for heavy users
Such an amazing product!!!!.very compact and handy.i have got that for a good offer price.simply go for it.dont get distracted to negative reviews.
nice small packed with powerful processor i like it.got Little bit heated while using too much continue .
"Battery backup is very poor, even it not last long than 5 to 6 hours on a normal usage and 5.5” screen size is very small to use, but other performance are good"
"It is good one , purchased it for 54kSometimes very rarely it heats up otherwise it is good in general."
"Best 2021 iPhone u can get for cheapest price, 5.4 inch bahut h aaj k standard meh bhi , switched from 6.4 inch display but then also no issue , enjoying every thing with this phone"
"Camera is superb. Previous Android user like me may find it little bit inconvenient, but if you wanna buy apple only, this is a good phone. Battery backup is not that bad."
""
Very bad product !
Size is very very small .. after paying huge amount .. price should be under 40k for this Size is very very small .. after paying huge amount .. price should be under 40k for this
The produce received was tampered and had scratches on them
"Very good performance,touch sensitivity, camera quality for both selfie and back are good and storage is adequate for all my needs highly recommended good product at a good price :)"
Awesome if you love small sized phones!
"Not worth to buy, touch doesn’t work properly after using screen protector"
"I've always been wanting a smaller phone to use while running, talking etc. iphone mini is perfect in every sense. So happy with this purchase"
awesome phone nothing beats iphone
Overall it is good
"Finally a perfect phone which fulfils my use case. Small, Packed with features & Fast.Yes, battery is a downer if you use the phone constantly. For me its perfect."
Good phone. Battery is good for a day and camera is awesome.
"Works like a charm. Battery is superbly optimised and is efficient with A14 chipset.Amazing display, nice speakers( good depth), marvellous camera.It’s like small battery but full power."
Value for money
"Very good item, very good amazon delivery and delivery agent Rafikul behaviour awesome"
Ok ok experience
Nice product ......camera also good but size is small if you are switching from a big phone
Battery life is a aerate compared to IPhone XR. But I like this compact size factor.
"For: fits easily in jeans pocket, compact, light weight, easy to carry specially while travelling, screen quality. Against: typing becoz of small screen size - feels congested."
MiNi champ is great...
"If you are okay with certain limitations like low battery life,small screen, certain apps not configured for 12mini, it's extremely superb phone."
The media could not be loaded. Its an amazing experience.
Its a power house in its Size Category
Difficult to get used to apple from android

"An awesome phone with impeccable design and specifications. It’s an iPhone man jst get it. Oled screen, amazing cameras , decent battery life and color variants spcly the blue one. Proud owner of iPhone mini"
"One of the best purchase so far its the best size iphone i have ever got in a while i love the size its not too big not too small , got it for 71k totally worth it , the seamless experience and 5G speed is unchallenged , i hear people have been complaining about battery life it’s actually not that much of an issue it will last 5 - 6 hrs easy but if you game damn it’s gonna go low very quick on 60fps. The best Camera you have in a smartphone.Highest performance in a smartphone.Lag free .No worries on privacy or ever getting a virus/malware so you can enter your card details without worrying about anybody ever tracking you.Amazing built-in quality.Battery is average but since you can afford a phone like this I assume you travel in car so really what battery problem?"
"Bought my first iPhone with the hope as it’s said to be a phone for professionals.Trust me, I have been just saving battery as it’s low. I have limited apps so that it doesn’t consume much battery.Of course it’s iPhone but I feel its for the one who just need 3 to 4 Hr of daily use like chatting, messaging etc."
"A lot of reviews must have mentioned the battery being small, but then again if you are buying 12 mini it's for a purpose which is definitely not gaming. I was looking for a flagship with a small screen size. Sadly android has non to offer ie a small screen phone with a flagship specs. Hence I moved to iOS for the first and don't regret the move. We carry phones around everywhere from gym to offices and small phone is what caters to the purpose. Utility is more important than just screen size. If you are someone for whom real life utility matters more than there is nothing better than this currently in the market. Battery is a little less for sure but nothing you can't handle with a little planning"
"Very bad quality , glass broken and money too much high, calling facility is bad battery damaged,ear phone not working"
"Big features in small packet. Very happy with my buy this year. I upgraded from iPhone 8 Plus to iPhone mini. Now I cannot imagine going back to giant size phones in future. It’s super handy, has all features of iPhone 12 and fits in pocket. Camera is the best in class, battery is bit less. If one is a moderate phone user then battery is sufficient for full day use.Unless you have a lighting cable charger from previous iPhone you will have to buy charger at extra cost. So go for iPhone 11 if you don’t want to shell extra bucks for basic things like charger. Using the phone since 2 months now. Loving it."
"*****Using for 5 months*****Pathetic experience with apple customer care ****Summary: I have purchased the phone in Oct 2021 and I had to register a case with consumer helpline in Feb 2022. If you think you will get premium service because you have purchased a premium phone, you are terribly mistaken. Its always good to keep a standby (android/windows/basic) phone if you want to continue to be connected. Software complaint detected on 1st Feb and requested support from Apple customer care. Senior escalation team has wasted my 15 days however couldnt find a resolution. Finally, I lost all the data from i-cloud and from memory. Details are below if you are interested to know further. If you are self-declared iPhone promoter, better save your valuable time 😊****What was the issue with your i-phone?I faced a software complaint of Apple ID locked due to security reasons; need to reset password. Every time I unlock the password, it gets locked in the next second and it prevented me from using the phone or downloading any new application. There is a permanent notification in the apple Id suggestion that says, Some application in your phone require login with your apple ID. When I login with the ID, error pops up Unknown error occurred. When I clicked on Forgot password I was able to reset the password successfully. However, logging in again with the new password same error repeats. This continued in a never-ending loop.*****How the Apple customer Care team treated you so that you are very angry?They have flowered me with sweet words and high respect. They said that they are excited to help me. Also, every caller assured me that he/she would be taking the responsibility of my problem and will remain single contact point till the end.******You only said that Apple customer care people were so kind. Then why are you spreading negative information?Brother, when you raise a complaint, your primary requirement is to resolve the issue at the earliest and nothing else. Apple customer care did everything other than supporting with my issue.When I called first time, the Customer care executive listened my problem very carefully and asked to restart. I told her that I have done all soft techniques such as restart, reset, Restore etc. I am done with all options available in and outside apple website. Nothing helped that is why I called you. After 45 minutes of Sweet conversation she got finally convinced that the issue cannot be resolved by herself. She escalated to senior escalation team. Post usual welcome dialogues, senior escalation team wanted to listen my issue again 😌; I explained again. He understood the problem after 45 minutes and started to give same directions as the Customer executive given 😊 I told the same thing that I have tried all. But he insisted me to do that again over the call. Since restore activities are time consuming he promised me a call back and provided me a link to connect back him in case of any question. After doing the restore through I phone, there was no change. Instead, I lost all the application in the phone. Neither the SENIOR ESCALATION EXPERT called me back. Funniest part is that I am unable to communicate him through the link since it required APPLD ID login that doesnt work for me. ( I still doubt these guys understood my issue )I understood they are following a YouTube video that I have already seen. It seems the senior technical escalation team is being recruited after passing spoken English course. Sometimes I felt I am the expert 😊Hopefully you understood why I am frustrated. I had to call back customer care again repeat the step above of wasting 1 hrs to 1.30 hrs to find out NO solution!!!******Did the issue resolve?Unfortunately, no. I lost my entire data when the phone was restored in recovery mode. Since I couldnt disconnect the apple ID and phone, technical team had to help me and TAT for this action is 30 days. I requested for an alternate device as my work is getting impacted during this period, but they sweetly said NO. I had to purchase a new phone to continue with my work.****What is the status of your Consumer helpline complaint?I understand that the complaint has reached to Apple, and they are trying to please me through some tricks but not listening to my demands. I requested for compensation against the phone that I have purchased during this issue. I think this is going to be a long fight I am prepared for it.*******Thank you for reading. I hope this review will help you to take a right decision before making significant investment. ******"
"To start with bought the mini from an offline store but not much of a price difference though. Just wanted immediately in my hands and don’t want to wait till it get delivered.Coming from Samsung galaxy S9 and realme x2 pro android phones, iOS is a breath of fresh airMain reason to buy the mini is because of the form factor. After using it for couple of days even my old S9 feel huge and bulky in my hands. Such a in hand feel. Completely love it.Don’t won’t to say much about other features like performance, display, camera etc. they are class leading and top notch.One thing on battery life. It’s more than decent and for a average user like me who just uses phone for calls and social media battery life is more than enough and lasts for a full day. In fact battery was one of main concern before I bought this phone. Now feeling relieved. Planning to use the phone as long as it is alive. Never felt this much satisfaction with my previous phones.Highly recommend if your budget is above 55k and not a heavy user, you will love it and trust me it will stand out in the crowd."
"One thing which i like is camera,size and worst thing is battery life ...it hardly gives 4 to 5 hrs if we use continuously ...When u have fastest processor and battery is dying so fastly whats the use of phone...Huge flop model...If u have less budget go for 11 much better than this ..People who want to play games should forget this phone"
"Well i am frm Andrioid, and after getting this mini and using it for almost a month i am wondering whts there in an iPhone. Anyways, the face recognition is excellent ! if u put up a nice cover it will fell sturdy in hand. I bought HOSS lighting to usb converter as a charger (do buy the 2 piece at 500+/-). The sound of ringtone is fine but for any kind of text messages its too low. Battery is not for users who travel frequently and use their phones too often, basically it drains fast. And some of the apps don't go full screen, that when u realize its mini.The button clicks and its sound are out of sync (ha ha ha...)DON'T buy it just because u want a iPhone !! Believe me there is nothing exiting than an android here."
Very small even for small hands. Looks premium. Red colour is my favourite. I returned it because it is so tiny.
"Pros:1. Size and Design of the phone2. All premium features of 12 series in a compact phone except the extra camera features3. OLED screen and Stereo sound makes it cool4. Camera quality of Day as well as night time picturesCons:1. Battery - Only for Heavy users (If you are a light user it will last a day, or if Office worker dont need to worry)2. Not for Gamers - Heats while gaming due to the small size of the phone its easily noticeable3. Aluminium Frame - Gets easily scratched by small dust accumulation if using cover (White colour is exception, 12 pro and Pro max models are stainless steel)4. 12 mini model issue - Using tempered glass and cover both causes touch issue"
"Those planning to buy the green colour phone be wary. It is not the same green as shown in the pictures, it is light dull boring green. I didn't check personally in a shop and got the green one and now regretting the color choice. Otherwise phone is small, sleek, fits in hand and powerful. Doing with my new MacBook Air charger, charges slow. For new phone the battery life is ok. I am not sure when it becomes a year old. Overall happy with the phone, sic with the color."
"I used 5s , SE ,iphone 6s+ in the past and my current primary phone was Google pixel 2xl for the past 2.5 years and my wife is using SE 2. So based on the overall experience i can rate only 3 stars for the iphone mini because of its huge price tag.I am comparing this with the current gen SE 2. Ofcourse they are saying led display and all but if you compare to SE 2 you wont notice any difference at all. Infact SE 2 Display color accuracy is better for my eyes.Comparing to Camera. Its almost identical results in day light photos with the main cam. And wide lens is not that great in low light . Front camera is good.Speaker sound is good for both the phones but for Mini the ear peice quality is not good. Sounds very thin and volume is low compared SE 2Very handy to be single handed use and the face unlock is pretty fast.But just for the above 2 good points spending so much on this mini is not justifiable that too doesnt have a charging brick and earphones.So if you are looking for a compact iphone SE 2 is the best ever option. And during offers base model SE 2 was availble for 26k which is very much worth of that price tag.Update on 17/02/2021 from 3 start to 5 star.After using the phone for 2 weeks i can say this is really a great and power packed compact phone. Camera is really awesome and the battery backup is adequate for 1 day heavy usage (no games) . I think most of the compact phone lovers dont prefer to play games on there small screen.Overall kidialm phone man. Strictly for compact phone lovers. Others dont even think of it because you wont be liking it after paying such a huge amount of money instead can go for regular 12."
"Apparently you can’t return this phone even if you’re thoroughly dissatisfied with the phone.NO WHERE on the iOS app is it mentioned though, they just assume that every buyer will visit the website also and check the returns policy instead of reading up on the phone.The phone is terrible with poor battery life and a ridiculously small screen size, somehow it doesn’t feel like 5.4” since it curves at the side.Now I’m stuck with this phone because Amazon won’t even take this back.My sincere advice is to avoid this phone at all costs.It’s possibly the worst iPhone money can buy."
"A thread on MacRumors with more than 250 replies found over 25% of iPhone users are impacted by the problem, there are also numerous complaints in the official Apple Support Communities forum. Given Apple has around 300M iPhone 12 and iPhone 11 models, if the MacRumors polling is representative, this is a huge problem.My personal opinion is this is not Apple throttling iPhones. The company claims battery improvements in recent years mean it no longer has to resort to such aggressive measures and the iPhone 12 range is just six months old, which is far too soon for any form of throttling (which Apple did to protect battery health). An urgent fix in the form of iOS 14.5.2 looks like the obvious answer.In the meantime, owners of iPhone 12 and iPhone 11 models have a tough decision to make. Do you leave your iPhones vulnerable to two serious security flaws or do you upgrade and risk a 1-in-4 chance of having the performance slashed in half? Whatever path you choose, Apple needs to address this, and fast.I have contacted Apple and will update this post if I receive a response."
"12 mini is absolutely a beast, but for this price range it lacks somewhere. While talking about battery it is absolutely waste. 6-8 hrs of on screen performance. Which certainly let's expectations down. You can go for se2 if small size attract you. But 70k for 12 mini is just waste. ""Small and cute"""
Found scratches after unboxing item. It was ment to be my wife's first anniversary gift. It contains some persons junk on the library.No option to request replacement. Slot for technican visit is not available.
I switched from an iPhone xr to iPhone 12 mini. The only doubt I had was about the battery life. But don't worry guys the battery life is really good. I felt it to be bttr than my iPhone xr. I have given the picture of 12 mini besides a 6s just so that u guys can compare the size. If u like a small phone then go for it...battery life if good don't worry about it.
Sincere request to all- Do not buyBattery zindagi: PatheticCamera: Check Youtube; has major issues. Ypu can't click. Sends a buzzing noise whenever camera is switched on; like an electric shockFinger touch input: at times we have to touch on select options multiple times for the action to be implementedPlus so expensive
"I'm using this phone for about a month now, instead of battery life everything is lightning fast and overall it's a perfect phone. It' really teaches me how unnecessarily big my old phone was."
"I'm owning iPhone 6s, 7 plus, 8 plus, XS Max, 11pro and latest 12pro max and 12 mini too. I love fluidity of iOS. If you start using iPhones (infact all Apple products) you never gonna think about anything else.But the thing I hate most is: battery! From 6 to 12pro max, apple never focused much on their batteries. As iOS and hardware is well optimised, we can get most out of it. But still for a medium to high user, that tiny battery is not sufficient. If you are willing to carry a power bank along with your iPhone, I'll suggest you to buy that. Personally I use to keep a Android (currently OnePlus 7 pro), so it use to manage my day. But as you are paying this much amount, so u need to get a better battery too. Or you can carry a extra device with you."
"Needed a compact phone that would last me a good five years. Unfortunately didn’t see that happening with any of the android phones I owned before(this is subjective), hence switched to Apple and went with iPhone mini instead of the SE 2020 given the better screen, the design ergonomics and a better battery life.The experience has so far been very positive. I get a full day out of its battery. I’m not a heavy user and my usage is limited to browsing(web and YT), messaging and couple of video/voice calls. Haven’t got a chance to explore more of its camera capabilities but of what I have seen the stills are crisp and the videos shot in 4K superb.If you are someone who’s life doesn’t revolve around your phone then I’d say just go for it. This phone is the epitome digital minimalism."
Super phone with amazing performance but a thumbs down in batteryI would recommend only for light users and not for heavy users
"The ceramic glass which Apple claims to be the toughest screen ever is not up to the mark. I used my blackberry with gorilla glass for more than 3 years without screen guard, still no noticeable scratch. But this phone has got scratches in just three months of usage. Better not fall for Apple’s toughest screen ever claim and protect it with a screen guard like you would do for any ordinary glass screen."
"Phone is smooth like butterCamera is good and 4K video at 60fps feels like professional cameraBattery easily lasts for 14 hours with continuous use of about atleast 10 hours of screen timeBattery is not that bad as it is mentioned in the internetAnd if even with less battery capacity the benefit you get is the quick charging capability even a 10 mins quick charge gives you very much of difference for the rest of the dayPhone is not recommended for gaming, phone heats up after awhile but you can play flow lesslyTrust me the size of this phone is addictive.Much power in a small phone."
I wish i had this phone..But i am too poor to buy this ...I love apple..Wish i could get one someday
"iPhone in india is just a status symbol. And mostly used by girls. People using iphone hardly knows it's features but use IPHONE. Over priced phone with good feature, is what iphone gives you.Can someone help me to calculate how much it cost for a decent phone (6gb + 64gb) + go pro"
A really overkill phone with awesome camera and a really optimised operating system with the apps. This is what a phone should look like handy and compact. Not a huge 6 inches or bigger phones.
"The resolution, feel and performance everything is just great. You can reach all four corners easily, the size is perfect . I have the red one and it’s beautiful, eye catching.If you want a small size compact phone in this budget go for this."
Awesome but apple has stopped production of iphone mini.More words becoz more words required becoz i wrote less words
"Personally, this is best phone for me because of it's size. There is no catch in this phone.Battery life was fine for me. I don't game much. I am getting 5-6 hrs of S.O.T. anyway.Cameras are heart melting😍"
Best sound and display. and performance is very good .and built quality is premium also and software experience is best . Nice camera quality. good phone in this price range.
"Mini is very comfortable in hand, perfect for one hand operating. You start loving it for sure. Might hate big screen Android phones once using mini."
totally unbelievable that a company released a phone without its basic feature aka charger.and everyone who has more than enough money went crazy .
Pocket phone 🥳 which I was waiting for ❤️ Sexiest iPhone ever...nothing can beat this mini...it’s just wow trust me
Nice packing gift package looks good very nice delivery experience awesome color. Must buy product from Amazon online shop thank
I bought this phone 2 months back for my mom and the screen size isn't that big but still is really handy and comfortable to use the performance of the phone is top-notch and the camera and speaker quality is perfect.

SE 2 has more usable screen. Face ID is over rated - not really convenient especially in these days when one uses a face mask.

This is the best phone ever. Oled screen is amazing. Its a mini so it perfectly fit in my hand.
No. 1 iPhone in The World . I Saw From iPhone. I Switched From Android . Cheapest iPhone in the world
"Also, Is your Siri AI dumb and miss-hear? Idk but the one i have is so defective/dumb. It do not recognises my voice even if i have set it. Also, it mistakes my voice with other’s.And i miss fingerprint scanner. Other than this i like every other aspect of this phone. Screen size is not a deal breaker for me, in-fact it’s amazingly satisfying to me."
Awesome and HandyNice delivery and reliable delivery by Apprip RetailHave purchased a lot of appliances from them never disappointed
Must buy if you Like smaller phones. Its got all features packed into a small body. Great performance. Great camera.
Awesome product received with great discount
Screen quality and touch screen very smooth
Apple is apple. Hehehahaha.
I love my iPhone.
"iPhone 12 mini - its an awesome phone, i got more than one full day battery life with just small settings change.change display to dark mode - select low power mode - off background apps refresh rate - OFF bluetooth + mobile data & Wi-Fi if not necessary - avoid playing games...iam using all the apps, its rocking even after all the above settings done, don't believe battery myths,also use apple original 20w fast charger & spigen case, they protects your mobile very well."
3 days before Amazon offer price for 128 gb white iphone 12 mini is 64900 without any offer..... now it shows 4k higher. ... didn't buy.
"I’ll be honest. Product is absolutely great, no cons , just small size can be a issue for large screen lovers. Im just disappointed with the pricing. In my opinion , it should have been at a maximum price of 58k … But i paid 73k for 128gb variant. I hope apple does something for indian lovers because money is no joke.. and i would suggest that dont buy 64gb and also price should have been 55k - 58k"
Apple I phone the name itself everything.not required any compliments.Excellent product overall things are nice.Nice delivery time by Amazon
I just say that this iPhone is awesome. Small phone. easy to use and it fits in the pocket easily.
Not good product. Requires better battery. Color not good for resale value. Camera is average. Do not buy. ... Sndh
I love this colour and brand also..I wish that I could buy this....but my God knows when it's possible.. or impossible...😔😔😔😔😔😔
"This phone is small and amazingIts performance is super fast, battery could have been better, otherwise it’s the best."
